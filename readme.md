Widget Dropdowns
================

This is a simple proof-of-concept piece which demonstrates the use of a widget area as a "mega menu" dropdown. It is packaged as a WordPress theme for easy installation and portability. Please see [http://wordpress.mfields.org/2011/dropdown-widgets/].

Installation
------------

1. Download the most recent version.
2. Add it to wp-content/themes.
3. Log into WordPress.
4. Activate the Widget Dropdowns theme.
5. Add a few widgets to the "Dropdowns" widget area.

Goals for 1.0
-------------

1. The UI should not only work for a widget areas but should extend to the output of wp_nav_menu() and wp_page_menu() as well.
2. Javascript should be respectful of different container sizes. This will help accomodate as many themes as possible as well as make responsive layouts easier to make.

Status
------

Unstable! Sorry about that. Tag 0.2.1 may hold a working example of this if you are interested.
